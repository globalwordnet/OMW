<h3>OMW Wordnet Documentation</h3>

<p>This page provides documentation for the structure of the
  <a href="{{ url_for('omw_welcome') }}">Open Multilingual
    Wordnet</a>.


<p>A wordnet is semantic network.  Synonymous words (including MWEs)
  are grouped into synsets.  These synsets are then linked to other
  synsets via semantic relations such as {{ ssrel('hypernym') }}.  
  Ideally, the meaning of a synset is further
clarified with a short defining definition (or gloss) and or more usage examples.

<p>Originally, <a href='{{url_for('omw_wn', proj='pwn', ver='3.0')}}'>Princeton WordNet</a> only included the lexical categories
  of major content words: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.  Other
  wordnets have added other parts of speech, such as pronouns and exclamatives.

<p>In Princeton Wordnet, at the top level, nouns are organized into 25
beginner "trees" for nouns and 15 for verbs (called lexicographic
files at a maintenance level). All are linked to a unique beginner
synset, "entity". Noun hierarchies are far deeper than verb
hierarchies. Adjectives are not organized into hierarchical
trees. Instead, two "central" antonyms such as "hot" and "cold" form
binary poles, while 'satellite' synonyms such as "steaming" and
"chilly" connect to their respective poles via a "similarity"
relations. The adjectives can be visualized in this way as "dumbbells"
rather than as "trees".

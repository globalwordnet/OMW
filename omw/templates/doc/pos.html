<p>Princeton WordNet defines the original four open class parts of
  speech: either
  {{ili_link(69690, "noun")}},
  verb, adjective, or adverb. Satellite adjectives
are in clusters representing a concept that is similar in meaning to
the concept represented by its head synset.  We map them internally to adjectives.

<p>Conjunctions and adpositions are reserved for extending to new
  semi-open classes.

<p><strong>x</strong> is used for non-referential words such as
  particles, classifiers, exclamatives, greetings, determiners and so forth.

<p><strong>z</strong> is used for phrases, for example to
  represent <i>phrasets</i>, introduced by <a href='Beyond Lexical
  Units: Enriching Wordnets with Phrasets'>Luisa Bentivogli and
    Emanuele Pianta (2003)</a>.
  <br><strong>DEPRECATED</strong> better to
  use <strong>lexicalized</strong> instead.
  
<p><strong>u</strong> Is for automatically produced wordnets that want
  to add words for which they are not sure of the part-of-speech.

  <h4>Non-lexicalized Synsets and Senses</h4>
  
<p>We have an optional attribute <code>lexicalized</code> lexicalized
on the synset and sense types, with a boolean value, defaulting to
true. This was inspired by the Basque and MultiWordNet projects.

<p>If a synset is marked as lexicalized False then it means it has no
lemmas, and this is a deliberate decision on the part of the wordnet
builders (but the synset may be included to keep the hierarchy in sync
with other projects). For example the synset <i>dedos</i> "fingers and toes"
in Spanish would be <code>lexicalized=false</code>
  in English.

<p>If a sense has lexicalized true then it has been validated in some
standard lexicon for the language. If it has lexicalized false, then
it is believed to be compositional and only added as an aid to
multilingual users (similar to <i>phrasets</i> in multiwordnet). For example
harimau anak "young tiger" in the Indonesian synset for tiger cub is
<code>lexicalized=false</code>, or dedos pedas "foot finger-and-toes" in the synset
for toe in Spanish.



<h3>Developers' Notes</h4>

<p>The pos are entered when the database is first created
  using <code>scripts/load-pos.py</code> and are stored in the
  table <code>pos</code>.

    
{% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
  {% if messages %}
    {% for message in messages %}
      {{ message }}
    {% endfor %}

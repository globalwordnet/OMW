<h4 id="marketing">Marketing</h4>
<p>The marketing team promotes and spreads information about this organization, carries promotional operations, ensures the proper communication of Open Multilingual Wordnet with the outside world, keeps the social media presence, presents the software in a crisp and compelling style.</p>

<p>The concept of Open Multilingual Wordnet is admirable where individual wordnets are linked to wordnets in other languages, which makes these wordnets more easily accessible. But the world needs to know about this free tool so that more people can take the benefits of this tool and join our mission.</p>

<p>We encourage out-of-the-box thinking, and we believe every idea is important to spread this free tool to the world. It’s going to be a process of executing a marketing plan with an entire community.</p>
